# Ethereum Fraud Detection Dataset

## üìñ Overview
This project analyzes Ethereum wallet behavior to classify addresses as either phishing (fraudulent) or normal.  
I started with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand behavioral differences between normal and fraudulent accounts, using visualizations to uncover patterns in transaction activity. Then, I applied machine learning to build a predictive fraud classification model based on these insights.

## üéØ Objective

- Explore wallet behavior patterns between phishing and normal accounts.
- Visualize key differences and detect outliers.
- Train models to classify fraud, including logistic regression, KNN, and ensemble methods such as random forest and XGBoost.
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìÇ Dataset

Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Ethereum Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vagifa/ethereum-frauddetection-dataset)  
The dataset contains 9,841 Ethereum wallet addresses with 49 behavioral features.

#### üéØ Target Variable: `FLAG`
- `1`: Phishing (fraudulent address)
- `0`: Normal address

## üîç Key Findings

- **Class Imbalance**  
  Out of 9,816 Ethereum addresses, **22.2%** were flagged as phishing, indicating a need for class-balancing techniques.

- **ERC-20 Activity Insight**  
  Many addresses with missing ERC-20 values had no corresponding token transfers. These were logically **imputed as zeros** to reflect no activity.

- **Transaction Timing**  
  - **Phishing wallets** often sent transactions **instantly** (median = 0 minutes), showing burst-like, immediate behavior.  
  - **Normal wallets** had a higher median delay (~23 minutes) and a broader range, suggesting more organic or sustained usage.

- **Value Behavior**  
  - Phishing wallets typically **sent small amounts** of ETH ‚Äî 50% of them sent ‚â§ 1 ETH.  
  - They also **received significantly smaller amounts** ‚Äî half received less than 2 ETH.  
  - Normal wallets showed **higher and more varied transaction values**, both sent and received.

- **Interaction Behavior**  
  - **Phishing wallets** interacted with a **larger number of unique addresses**, often one-time interactions with potential victims.  
  - **Normal wallets** showed **more frequent interactions** with a smaller, stable set of addresses.

- **Transaction Volume (Bar Chart Insight)**  
  - **Phishing wallets** had **fewer sent and received transactions**, suggesting short-lived or one-off activity.  
  - **Normal wallets** had **higher activity levels**, reflecting consistent and ongoing use of the network.
 
## üß† Modeling Summary

I trained and evaluated multiple models for fraud detection:
- **Logistic Regression** for interpretability.
- **KNN** to explore local neighborhood behavior.
- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** for non-linear pattern detection.

**XGBoost** achieved the best performance:
- Accuracy: over 95%
- Precision (fraud): ~90%
- Recall (fraud): ~86%

### üîù Top 10 Significant Features Impacting Suspicious Flag (from Logistic Regression)

| Feature                                   | Coefficient    | Direction | Interpretation                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `received_higher_sent`                    | **-3.0399**    | ‚Üì         | Addresses that receive more Ether than they send are **much less likely** to be flagged. Indicates legitimate accumulation.        |
| `ERC20_received_higher_sent`              | **2.1437**     | ‚Üë         | Receiving more ERC20 tokens than sending is **strongly associated** with being flagged. May reflect malicious collection behavior. |
| `Time Diff between first and last (Mins)` | **-1.101e-05** | ‚Üì         | Longer active duration **reduces** the chance of being flagged ‚Äî fraudulent wallets often have short lifespans.                    |
| `ERC20 uniq rec contract addr`            | **0.0530**     | ‚Üë         | More unique ERC20 receiving contract addresses **increase** the odds of being flagged. May reflect opportunistic or bot behavior.  |
| `Avg min between sent tnx`                | **1.178e-05**  | ‚Üë         | Longer gaps between sent transactions are **linked to higher risk** ‚Äî suggesting inactivity or bursts of malicious activity.       |
| `Sent tnx`                                | **-0.0090**    | ‚Üì         | More outgoing transactions **decrease** the risk ‚Äî reflects active, legitimate behavior.                                           |
| `max val sent`                            | **-0.0008**    | ‚Üì         | Higher maximum sent values are **associated with lower** risk ‚Äî possibly large, legitimate transfers.                              |
| `Total ERC20 tnxs`                        | **-0.0024**    | ‚Üì         | More ERC20 transactions **reduce** the likelihood of being flagged. Likely reflects legitimate trading behavior.                   |
| `Received Tnx`                            | **-0.0004**    | ‚Üì         | Higher number of received transactions **lowers** risk ‚Äî shows network activity.                                                   |
| `ERC20 total Ether received`              | **2.717e-11**  | ‚Üë         | A small but positive effect ‚Äî more ERC20 token value received correlates with a **slightly higher** chance of being flagged.       |

The **Pseudo R-squared** of 0.4716 indicates that the model explains ~47% of the variation in the target variable. This is considered a strong fit for classification problems involving behavioral or fraud detection data.
